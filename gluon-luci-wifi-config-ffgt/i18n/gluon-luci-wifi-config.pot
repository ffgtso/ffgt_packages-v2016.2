"You can enable or disable your node's client and mesh network SSIDs here. "
"Please don't disable the mesh network without a good reason, so other nodes "
"can mesh with yours.<br /><br />It is also possible to configure the WLAN "
"adapters transmission power here. Please note that the transmission power "
"values include the antenna gain where available, but there are many devices "
"for which the gain is unavailable or inaccurate.<br /><br />"
"&raquo;Nighttime peace&laquo;, if activated, will <em>shut off</em> the client "
"network between 22:00 and 06:00; all users therefore would be kicked off your "
"node, whereas the mesh network is kept running. Please use with care, it is "
"implemented so that, especially in the summer, people won't hang around all "
"night in residential areas and cause disturbance to the neighbours."
